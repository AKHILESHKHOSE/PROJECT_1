# Project Title:   Sports Analytics using SQL: Delving into IPL Cricket Data

# Description:

Embark on a data-driven exploration of IPL cricket matches! This project leverages the power of SQL to analyze two comprehensive datasets:

A. Ball-by-ball data: 
Dive into the heart of action with detailed information on each delivery, including batsman, bowler, runs scored, and wicket details.

B.Match-wise data: 

Gain a holistic view of each match with summaries like teams playing, winner, venue, and other match-level statistics.
Through in-depth analysis, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, predict future outcomes, and gain valuable insights into the dynamic world of IPL cricket.

# Technologies Used:

SQL (Structured Query Language): The foundation for extracting meaningful data from the provided datasets.
PostgreSQL (Optional, highly recommended): A powerful open-source database engine ideal for this project.
Git (Version control): Track changes and collaborate effectively.
GitHub (Code hosting platform): Share your project and insights with the community.
Getting Started:

# Clone the repository: 
Open your terminal or command prompt and run: 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sports-analytics-sql.git

1. Set up your database:
Install PostgreSQL: Follow the official guide: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

2. Create a database:
 Use a descriptive name (e.g., ipl_analytics).

3.Import the data: 
Execute the provided SQL scripts (create_tables.sql and import_data.sql) to create tables and populate them with the data.

4. Run the Query in PG ADMIN: 

5. Check the output and update queried time to time as per the requirement.

# Project Structure:

1.data: 
Contains the two datasets (ball-by-ball and match-wise) in CSV format.

2.sql: 
Holds SQL scripts for:
Setting up the database (tables and data import)
Performing various analyses (e.g., top batsmen, best bowling spells, venue performance)
Generating visualizations (optional)
documentation (optional): Provides additional explanations, insights, and potential extensions.

3.readme.md:
